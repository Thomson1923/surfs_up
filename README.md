# Re: Weather Analysis in Support of Surfing and Ice Cream Project 

# Overview of the analysis
## Comparing temperature patterns during June and December suggests that we should not see seasonal variations in demand based on weather. Unlike the wide temperature variations seen on the East Coast and West Coast of the United States during the typical 12-month period, our site on Hawaii should have weather supporting year-round surfing and ice cream sales.

# Results – The key findings of our analysis include:
## June Temperature Profile – Examination of 2010-2018 data indicates that we have a very high probability of temperatures near 75 degrees F during most days in June. Our statistical analysis shows that half of the temperature readings were within 2 degrees of the 75 degree F average and that the most extreme readings were within 11 degrees F.
## - December Temperature Profile – The mean temperature during December was 71 degrees F, still suitable to support the surfing and ice cream business. With a standard deviation of 3.75 degrees F, the data set indicates that the temperature range remains narrow. While the minimum temperature over the time period dipped to 56 degrees F, 75% of the days had temperatures above 69 degrees F and therefore could support the surf and ice cream demand. 
## - Key differences between June and December trends
### - June mean temperature nearly 4 degrees F above December mean temperature
### - Difference between min and max temperatures was greater in December (27 degrees F) than June (21 degrees F)
### - Standard deviation for December temperatures (3.75 degrees F) was greater than standard deviation for June temperatures (3.26 degrees F)

# Summary
## Our analysis of June and December data supports the favorability of Hawaii temperature patterns for our business. Additional analysis should include review of seasonal precipitation patterns to identify any potential problems and a station-by-station analysis to help identify the best location for our business.
